# CODEOWNERS - Define who must approve changes to specific files/directories
#
# When a PR modifies files, GitHub automatically requests review from the owners.
# Combined with branch protection "Require review from Code Owners", this enforces
# that changes cannot be merged without owner approval.
#
# Syntax: <pattern> <owner1> <owner2> ...
# Owners can be: @username, @org/team-name, or email
#
# More info: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Default owner for everything in the repo
# This catches any files not explicitly listed below
